# UUParser-CPH

This is a fork of [UUParser](https://github.com/UppsalaNLP/uuparser) modified for the paper:

Parameter sharing between dependency parsers for related languages, by Miryam de Lhoneux, Johannes Bjerva, Isabelle Augenstein and Anders SÃ¸gaard at EMNLP 2018.

Installation and usage instructions can be found on the original github repository. Our experimental settings can be used by adding options to parser training/prediction. There are 3 options `--word`, `--char` and `--mlp` which can be set to `shared`, `not_shared` or `shared_lembed` which correspond to hard sharing, not sharing and sharing with a language embedding of words, characters and the MLP respectively.
Note that the parser needs to be run with the option `--multiling` to train in multilingual mode.

To find out about more options, run

```
python barchybrid/src/parser.py --help
```
